    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <h3>What does it taste like?</h3>
    <p><strong>Chicken wings</strong> are white meat, even though they're <em>juicier</em> and have a more concentrated poultry flavor, like dark meat. Many people think of Buffalo wings when 
        they think of this part of the chicken, 
        and for good reason: they're extremely popular throughout the United States. The original <em>Buffalo wings</em> hail from Buffalo, New York, circa 1964:<em><strong> buttery,
         tangy, hot sauce-coated fried wings served with chilli garlic dip and celery sticks.</strong></em></p>
    <h3>Where to buy?</h3>     
    <p>Nearly any supermarket will sell chicken wings. Finding whole wings isn't as common as finding them pre-split into flats and drumettes — you may need to visit a butcher if you're looking specifically for whole wings (but call ahead first to make sure they have them in stock).
         Poultry stands at your local farmers markets will likely sell pasture-raised chicken wings. These tend to be a little leaner since these chickens are free-range and get more exercise than farmed birds, but have a lot more flavor and are raised more responsibly.</p>
